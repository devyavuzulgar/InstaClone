In the 2nd month of my Swift training, I learned to work with Firebase. I want to share my first small firebase project with you. I tested operations such as creating a database with Firebase. Additionally, in this project, I learned how to easily display photos downloaded from the internet with SDWebImage.

I would like to thank Atıl Smancıoğlu for what I learned in this training.

Note: I didn't focus too much on the UI part, my goal was to learn Firebase.
